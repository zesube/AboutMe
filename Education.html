            Hi there; I am pleased to share the highlights of my educational journey, which has been both transformative and rewarding.<br>
            I graduated from Decatur Central High School with an Academic and Technical Honors Diploma,
            achieving a rank in the top 20% of my class of 374 students.
        </p>

        <p>
            My academic path began at the Salt Lake Center for Science Education (SLCSE) High School in Utah,<br>
            where I was fortunate to immerse myself in math and science through hands-on learning experiences and field trips.<br>
            At SLCSE, I actively participated in the MESA club, which focused on fostering teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.<br>
            A particularly memorable highlight was our visit to the Hansen Dome Theater,<br>
            where I gained a deeper understanding of the universe through a unique blend of arts, storytelling, and film.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2021, I transitioned to Indiana, continuing my education at Decatur Central.<br>
            I successfully completed my sophomore year and quickly moved into my junior year, which presented numerous opportunities.<br>
            I received an invitation to apply for membership in the National Honor Society (NHS)<br>
            and had the chance to tour the Area 31 Career Center, where I subsequently enrolled in the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) program.
        </p>

        <p>
            Completing my junior year seamlessly led into my senior year, which was characterized by both challenges and significant growth.<br>
            Throughout my final year, I served as an active member of the National Honor Society<br>
            while participating in a job-ready program at Area 31 Career Center,<br>
            where I earned certifications in CPR and Emergency Dispatch.<br>
            Being part of the EMT program and NHS allowed me to further develop my leadership, problem-solving, and community service skills,<br>
            reinforcing my passion for teamwork and collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
            This journey has not only shaped my academic pursuits<br>
            but has also instilled in me a strong commitment to making a positive impact in my community.

                Hi, my name is Zawadi.<br>
                I am an IT student at Ivy Tech Community College, pursuing an Associate of Applied Science in Software Development.<br>
                My journey reflects a deep commitment to aligning my passion for design and development with a successful career in technology.<br><br>

                I have not yet had the opportunity to be part of a significant project that fully utilizes my skills;<br>
                however, I am eager to contribute to initiatives that allow me to showcase my design and creative abilities.<br>
                Although my experience in larger endeavors is limited, I have actively put my design and creative skills to the test independently,<br>
                which has significantly contributed to my professional growth.<br>
                This process has motivated me to apply the skills I have acquired in my coursework to real-world situations.<br>
                I am enthusiastic about collaborating on projects that will further develop my capabilities and impact.
